 HW Assignments from Statistical Computing in R, HW1 largely involves inverse transform methods and generating mixed distributions. HW2 involves Monte Carlo Integration and and other forms of estimations. HW3 involves gradient descent functions, and HW4 uses the Metropolis-Hastings Random Walk Sampler. Further details of the nature of the questions are expounded on below.
